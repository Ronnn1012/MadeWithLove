                To take from; to have taken away.
                <br><br>
                To catch; to be caught.
                <br><br>
                To conform; to make one conform.
                <br><br>
                We do nothing but repeat the affirmatives and negatives, and fight to keep ourselves from losing anything.
                <br><br>
                And yet our places and the people we love are certain to pass away.
                <br><br>
                We are certain to be forgotten.
                <br><br>
                To live is to be unhappy; It is futility.
                <br><br>
                But even so, knowing I will someday lose what I have, knowing I will someday be gone.
                <br><br>
                I still seek grotesquely.
                <br><br>
                I still hope to attain beauty.
                <br><br>
                And so, I choose. I keep on choosing.
                <br><br>
                I keep being chosen.
                <br><br>
                - Farewell... Someone Whom I Love The Most.

                - Thank You.
